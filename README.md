Would you slap a baby for a million dollars?

# Description
This is a two player tag platformer game where one player is a grandma and one player is a baby. The entire goal of this game is for the grandma to try and catch up to the baby and slap it. At the end of the game, the "grandma" must pick up our phone and "smack the baby" for a wonderful 3D animation of the baby being slapped and getting yeeted off into space.
